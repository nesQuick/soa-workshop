# Final Challenge

This challenge brings all things learned over the course of the SOA workshop together. It is your job to create multiple services that work together over the web.

## Intro

Your goal is to create a system that is used to track the inventory of a larger corporation. They run many offices in multiple locations and want to know how many pencils, staplers, computers, etc. they have in each of these locations.

As a good SOA developer your solution should come in 4 services:

* A user management system
* An item tracking system
* A system to manage the different locations
* A reporting system

We will run through all the different services one by one and all of them are stripped down to the bare minimum for this challenge. So no worries at all and lets get started!

## The Systems

## Important Aside

During this challenge you create 4 services. Remember that while trying to resemble real life conditions these services are not meant to be ready for any *production* use. Your focus should therefore lie on the interaction between services, not making the services itself *pretty*, super stable or super performant.
