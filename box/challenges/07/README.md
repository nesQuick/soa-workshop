# Challenge 07

* Turn the app from [challenge 06](../06) into a gem called ``hello_world_app``
* Make sure to build that gem into the ``hello_world_app`` sub-directory in this challenge's folder
* **Important** You web app's class should be ``HelloWorldApp::App`` as the main ``HelloWorldApp`` constant is a ``module`` now

# Setup

Once your gem is ready run ``bundle install`` before you can run the specs to test your gem.
