# Challenge 03

Use [Rack::Builder](http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/classes/Rack/Builder.html) to make an equivalent app to the one from [challenge 02](../02).

# Setup

Don't forget to install the dependencies using Bundler. You can speed this process up by using:

```sh
$ bundle install --local
```

which will try to resolve the dependencies only locally from on your machine.
