# Challenge 04

Use [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) to make an equivalent app to the one from [challenge 02](/walski/soa-workshop/tree/master/box/challenges/02).

# Setup

Don't forget to install the dependencies using Bundler. This time ``--local`` can't save you as we need to install Sinatra.
